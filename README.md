# SinGAN-Image-Copy-Detection

In this project we analyze the originality of the images generated by SinGAN (https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01164).

To do this we implement a copy-paste forgery detection algorithm proposed in the paper Efficient Dense-Field Copyâ€“Move Forgery Detection (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279916389_Efficient_Dense-Field_Copy-Move_Forgery_Detection).

Our report is available in this repository, and our notebook with the code and further details is available at https://mega.nz/folder/KlQSkCAJ#p7IHjkJurwox1v76_x8XHA
